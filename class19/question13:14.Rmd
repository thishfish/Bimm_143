# Introduction to Genome Informatics Lab
## Question 13/14

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
nrow(expr)

```

We have 462 samples. Found using nrow(). 

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

Using table(), I was able to determine sample size for each genotype. A/A = 108, A/G 233, G/G = 121. 

Now, I am going to make a boxplot to visualize this data. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(expr) + aes(x = geno, y = exp, fill = geno) + 
  geom_boxplot() 

g

```

Looking at this, you can tell that the median for A/A is around 32, the median for A/G is around 25, and the median for G/G is around 20. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
AA <- filter(expr, geno == "A/A")
mean(AA$exp)
median(AA$exp)

AG <- filter(expr, geno == "A/G")
mean(AG$exp)
median(AG$exp)

GG <- filter(expr, geno == "G/G")
mean(GG$exp)
median(GG$exp)

```
